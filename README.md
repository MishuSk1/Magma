## FAQ  

#### Where can I find more DLLs?

> The most reputable source to look for more DLLs is [UnknownCheats](https://www.unknowncheats.me/forum/search.php?searchid=18371288)

#### Where can I find more Scripts?

> The most reputable source to look for more Scripts is [V3rMillion](https://v3rmillion.net/)

#### Magma wont open when I run it!

 > You most likely left your antivirus enabled, or forgot to configure it to ignore Magma. If you don't have a third-party antivirus installed, read the section below on how to disable Windows Virus and Threat Protection. 

#### Why does Magma flag as a virus?

> Due to the nature of Roblox exploits and the way they work (game manipulation, raw code injection, etc.) you need to disable Windows Security if on Windows 10 Home or Pro, and Windows Defender if on Windows 10 Enterprise and above, and if you have another antivirus software installed configure it to allow all files within the Magma directory ( Default: `C:\Program Files (x86)\Magma\` ). Magma is not a virus, and will not work with an unconfigured antivirus enabled, since it will automatically remove important files required for the application to launch. You can learn how to turn off Windows Defender [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TJb9CuVAHMI). Technically Magma IaE *is* a virus, but it only infects roblox by giving you cheats!
